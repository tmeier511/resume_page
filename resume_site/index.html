                    Welcome to my first web page, created by using what I have
                    learned over the last year and a half. 
                    During that time I mostly 
                    focused on Python, but I did take a course on HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript that taught me the basics of creating a webpage. 
                    Since that class, I have done my own research and learning 
                    through various YouTube Academic channels and websites such as 
                    <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codeacademy.com</a>.
                    By creating this web page, I hope to effectively display what I have
                    learned and showcase my skills in hope of finding a new career in the IT field.
