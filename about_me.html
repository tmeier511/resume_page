<h2 id="second_header">About Me</h2>
<p id="about_me">
I have been in the hospitality/restaurant industry for sixteen years, with ten of those years spent in a manager position. I made the decision to go back to school and
obtain my Certificate in Software Development after the Corona Virus hit and greatly affected the service industry. I was lucky in that I was brought back to work after a few months,
but I did not want to be in that position again. After seeing how so many people switched to working from home and needing to use their computer to do so, a career in IT made sense. 
There are countless options to explore and discover, offering roles either more on the physical hardware side, or on the software development side. I have chosen the software path,
as I enjoy working with the code and data to create something and have it fulfill a function. 
<br>
The technical stuff aside, I am an active, energetic, responsible parent to my daughter. I like being outside when possible to do whatever activities, though I mostly enjoy things
involving a body of water and a motorized water craft. I look for new escape rooms to try and hope to do one of the zombie-themed rooms soon. I enjoy the time I spend with my family and friends 
and seek to have a work-life balance that allows me to recharge on my days off and come back rested and ready for the new work week. I enjoy a challenge and figuring out the solution to a problem, 
whether I am doing it by myself, or working with a team. I am not afraid of hard work and being hands on, and I am always looking to help those around me if possible.
